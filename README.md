This project was a collaborative effort between me and my university colleagues to develop a comprehensive solution for dental centers, The solution was built using object-oriented analysis and design principles and covers various aspects of dental center management, including patient management, appointment scheduling, and billing.

The project started with gathering requirements from dental centers and identifying the key use cases for the solution, The use cases were then used to create a class diagram that showcased the relationships between different classes and objects.

The project demonstrates our ability to apply object-oriented concepts in a real-world scenario, work effectively in a team, and deliver a functional solution.

This project is a great example of our understanding of object-oriented analysis and design and our ability to use it to build solutions that are scalable, maintainable, and efficient.

The implementation of the solution was done using HTML and CSS here is the link to see the code of this project : https://github.com/OsamaMayyat/Dental
